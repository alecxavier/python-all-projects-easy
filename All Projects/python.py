Carl Menger, an Austrian economist who wrote "Principles of Economics" in 1871, is considered by many to be the founder of the Austrian school of economics.
The key ideas of the Austrian school have evolved over the years through the input of various economists.
Other than Carl Menger, the Austrian school also includes names like Ludwig von Mises, Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, and Friedrich Hayek.
The Austrian school uses logic of a priori thinking to discover economic laws of universal application, whereas other mainstream schools of economics make use of data and mathematical models.
The early concepts of the Austrian school contributed significantly to the theory of diminishing marginal utility.
